set up rabbit mq server by running these commands 

Using Docker is the easiest way to get RabbitMQ up and running locally without manually managing dependencies.

	1.	Install Docker (if not already installed).
	â€¢	For Docker Desktop, follow the installation instructions for your platform (Windows, Mac, Linux).
	2.	Run RabbitMQ in a Docker Container:
	
    You can pull the RabbitMQ image from Docker Hub and run it as a container:

    docker run -d --hostname my-rabbit --name rabbitmq -p 5672:5672 -p 15672:15672 rabbitmq:3-management

    This command runs RabbitMQ with the management plugin enabled, allowing you to use a web UI at http://localhost:15672.
	The RabbitMQ broker itself will be available at localhost:5672.


    3.	Access RabbitMQ Management UI:
		Open your browser and go to http://localhost:15672.
		Default credentials:
		Username: guest
	    Password: guest

Notes :
* we can use wildcards routing keys to push into multiple queues provide the exchange should be a topic 
example purchase.* >>> this will push in all the queues with rounting key matching purchase.(anything). 
we provide exchange name and wildcard routing key here.

* we can use direct exchange to push into a single queue 

* in fanout exchange push data in all the queues present in that exachange. We only provide exchange name 
  here and empty routing key.
